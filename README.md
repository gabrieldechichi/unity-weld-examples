Personal set of examples for Unity-Weld: https://github.com/gabrieldechichi/unity-weld-examples

Currently the example set is very basic and inferior to the official example repo (https://github.com/Real-Serious-Games/Unity-Weld-Examples). But I'll update this repo with more advanced use cases as they come.
